## ERB and ice-cream cones <% %> and <=% %=>

ERB is embed ruby

meaning you can interpolate variables or run ruby code

It can then be converted to a string

ERB is like the f'this is python {hello} ' but for entire documents!

#### <% %> allow ruby with no output

#### <%= %> allows ruby with output (I mean like printing to the documents)
